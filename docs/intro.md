# Introduction

[XRPScan](https://xrpscan.com) is an explorer and analytics platform for the
[XRP Ledger](https://xrpl.org). We provide a clean and simple way to look up 
**accounts, ledgers, transactions, validators and amendments**.

We run a XRPL validator ([aloha.xrpscan.com](https://xrpscan.com/validator/nHDB2PAPYqF86j9j3c6w1F1ZqwvQfiWcFShZ9Pokg9q4ohNDSkAz)) 
that’s recommended by UNLs published by [XRPL Foundation](https://foundation.xrpl.org/), 
[Coil](https://coil.com/) and [Ripple](https://ripple.com/). We’re committed 
to the success of XRP and absolutely ❤ the XRP Community.

We hope you find this project useful and use our APIs to integrate with the 
XRP Ledger.
