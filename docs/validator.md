# Validator

We run a XRPL validator at [aloha.xrpscan.com](https://xrpscan.com/validator/nHDB2PAPYqF86j9j3c6w1F1ZqwvQfiWcFShZ9Pokg9q4ohNDSkAz) 
that’s that’s recommended by UNLs published by [XRPL Foundation](https://foundation.xrpl.org/), 
[Coil](https://coil.com/) and [Ripple](https://ripple.com/). Our node’s public
validation key is:

```

```

## Validator’s properties:
