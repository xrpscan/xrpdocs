Validator
=========

We run a XRPL validator at ``aloha.xrpscan.com`` that's included in 
`Ripple's <https://vl.ripple.com>`_ and `Coil's <https://vl.coil.com>`_ 
recommended node list (UNL). Our node's validation key is::

  nHDB2PAPYqF86j9j3c6w1F1ZqwvQfiWcFShZ9Pokg9q4ohNDSkAz

Validator's properties:

#. High I/O NVMe SSD disks in RAID configuration.
