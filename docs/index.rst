`XRP Scan <https://xrpscan.com/>`_ is an explorer for the ``XRP`` Ledger that

Introduction
------------
XRP Scan is an explorer and analytics platform for the ``XRP`` Ledger. We
provide a clean and simple way to look up your accounts, ledgers and 
transactions.

We hope you find this project useful and use it in your daily interaction with 
the ``XRP`` Ledger. There are several tasks that we're working on to make XRP Scan 
more useful and accessible. We'll roll out these changes as and when they are 
complete.

We run a ``XRPL`` validator (`aloha.xrpscan.com 
<https://xrpscan.com/validator/nHDB2PAPYqF86j9j3c6w1F1ZqwvQfiWcFShZ9Pokg9q4ohNDSkAz>`_) 
that's included in Ripple's and Coil's recommended ``UNL``. We're committed to 
the success of ``XRP`` and absolutely ‚ù§ the XRP Community. We hope you give us a
try and spread the word.
